# What jurisdictions are reporting

This is what the various jurisdictions are *reporting* near the end of the given day.
Each and every data point is linked to a supporting screen-shot of a web page, as of that time.
(It's hard to argue with a screen-shot.)

For Known Cases: the number given here is for both confirmed and probable/presumptive cases.

*Warning*: what a jurisdiction reports may not accurately reflect other sources.
For example, on 2020-03-31 NL was not reporting any deaths, but other sources were reporting the first death in NL before that date.

*Warning*: jurisdictions can report *as of* the previous day. ON does that at present. 
(That's likely the most logical way of reporting; otherwise, you are reporting on a day that hasn't completed yet.)
The data presented here is by date-reported.

The tables that link to supporting screen-shots:

* [Deaths](https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada/data/md/deaths.md)
