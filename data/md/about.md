# What's reported: daily screen-shots

This is what the various jurisdictions are *reporting* at approximately 21:00 EDT each day.
Each and every data point is linked to a supporting screen-shot of a web page, as of that time.
(It's hard to argue with a screen-shot.)

The *table* form of the data links to supporting screen-shots (*csv* does not):

 |Time series data|Table|CSV|
 |----|-----|---|
 |Known Cases (confirmed and probable/presumptive)|[table](https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada/blob/master/data/md/known_cases.md)|[csv](https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada/blob/master/data/csv/known_cases.csv) |
 |Deaths|[table](https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada/blob/master/data/md/deaths.md)|[csv](https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada/blob/master/data/csv/deaths.csv)|
 |Tests|[table](https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada/blob/master/data/md/tests.md)|[csv](https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada/blob/master/data/csv/tests.csv)|
 
*Warning*: what a jurisdiction reports may not accurately reflect other sources.
For example, on 2020-03-31 NL was not reporting any deaths, but other sources were reporting the first death in NL before that date.

*Warning*: jurisdictions can report *as of* the previous day. ON does that at present. 
(That's likely the most logical way of reporting; otherwise, you are reporting on a day that hasn't completed yet.)
The data presented here is by date-reported.
