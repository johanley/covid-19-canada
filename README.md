# COVID-19 stats reported by Canadian governments

Three data sets, all starting as of 2020-03-31:

* deaths (cumulative)
* known cases, both confirmed and probable/presumptive (cumulative)
* tests completed (cumulative)

## Tables and basic charts for the various jurisdictions

In these tables and charts, the nominal values always **link directly to the screenshot** from which the data-point originates.

**Warning**: the bar charts presented here don't render well (they max out) when the screen width is small.
If you see a problem, try using landscape instead of portrait.

More info about the source data is [here](https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada/blob/master/data/md/about.md).

The source of these stats are [screenshots](https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada/tree/master/data/screenshots) of 
various government web pages.
The screenshots are taken at about 21:00 ADT each day (after the update from BC).

If a jurisdiction hasn't updated that day, then it's recorded here as "N" (*not updated*).

Recording the actual screenshots is in imitation of [this project in the US](https://github.com/COVID19Tracking).
Screenshots are more robust than relying on archive.org's Way Back Machine.

The raw data is stored in simple [csv files](https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada/tree/master/data/csv).
The data is also available in the [json](https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada/tree/master/data/json) format.
All tables are charts are generated by scripts using the .csv files as the sole data source.
(The tables and charts are simply generated as markdown, and posted to this github repository.)
