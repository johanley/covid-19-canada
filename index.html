<h2>COVID-19 Canada<span class='home'></h2>

This website is currently only for programmers and web designers.
It simply provides a JSON API for fetching basic stats related to the COVID-19 epidemic, with a focus on Canada.

<P>The stats are stored as a simple Google spreadsheet, which is updated daily.

<P>The data on the spreadsheets fetched by this website, and made available as a JSON feed.
With the data available in that simple form, programmers can more easily create charts and tables related to the epidemic.

<P>This can be extended to other jurisdictions with little effort. 
As long as the data is in a spreadsheet having the same simple layout, this website is able create a JSON version of that data.

<P>For full documentation, please see <a href='https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada'>the project homepage on github</a>.
