   <h2>Generalities about the data</h2>
   
   <ul>
    <li>start-date is 2020-03-31
    <li>updated daily, at about 21h ADT (after BC updates)
    <li>resides on <a href='https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada'>this github repo</a>
    <li>backed by <a href='https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada/tree/master/data/screenshots'>screenshots</a> of government webpages. This lets anyone verify the data.
    <li>available as both <a href='https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada/tree/master/data/csv'>csv</a> and <a href='https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada/tree/master/data/json'>json</a> files
   </ul>
   
   <P>There are 3 data sets, for each of the 14 jurisdictions (10 provinces, 3 territories, and the federal government):
   <ul>
    <li>total reported <em>deaths</em> to date (cumulative).
    <li>total reported <em>cases</em> to date (cumulative). <em>Confirmed</em> cases plus <em>probable/presumptive</em> cases. Only confirmed cases have a positive test result. 
    <li>total completed <em>tests</em> (cumulative). Excludes <em>pending</em> tests. (Not reported by the federal government.)
   </ul>

   <h2>Defects in the data</h2>
   
   Not all jurisdictions update their stats every day: when that happens, it's recorded as <em>N</em>. 
   It will show up as an empty gap in time-series charts.
   
   <P>Not in sync: because of timing issues, it's common for the federal government's reporting of deaths and cases to <em>not
   add up</em> to corresponding numbers from the provinces and territories. 
   
   <P>No test-data from the CA jurisdiction: the federal government reports on deaths and cases, but not on tests.
   
   <P>Reporting delays: sometimes the reporting isn't very timely. For example, if the ultimate source of the 
   data is non-governmental (maybe a private long-term care home), it likely takes time for that data to get into government databases.
   
   <P>Reported cases versus actual cases: the number of cases reported should be treated with care. Not everyone is being tested, 
   and all tests have false-negatives and false-positives. The number of actual cases is usually larger than the number reported.
   
   <P>Tests-performed versus people-tested: people are often tested more than once.
   Most jurisdictions report on the tests-performed, broken down into positive and negative results.
   NL and NU report instead on the number of people tested, which is of course a different statistic.
   In spite of this difference, the NL and NU data is here treated the same as the other jurisdictions.

   
   <P>Backfill for NB tests, 2020-03-31 to 2020-04-16 inclusive: an error was made in gathering this data. 
   It has been back-filled using data from <a href='https://github.com/ishaberry/Covid19Canada'>this source</a>, and 
   from <a href='https://virihealth.com/'>virihealth.com</a>.
   This is the only case in which the data is not backed up by a screenshot of a government website.

   <P>More details are <a href='https://github.com/johanley/covid-19-canada/blob/master/data/md/about.md'>here</a>.
