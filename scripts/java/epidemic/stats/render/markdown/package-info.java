/** 
 Render tables or charts in simple markdown, to be posted 
 directly to the github repo.
 
 <P>This is the simplest possible way of creating useful tables and charts 
 out of the data. It doesn't require a separate top-level domain, or even github pages. 
 Just check the results into the repo, and view them there.
